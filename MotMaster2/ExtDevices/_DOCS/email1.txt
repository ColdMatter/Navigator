Hi,

I've just been executing the script

dds reset
dcp 0 spi:stp0=0x3fff0000028f5c29
dcp 1 spi:stp0=0x3fff0000028f5c29
dcp update:u
dcp start

probably 25 times on a FlexDDS-NG (DUAL) and the waveform *always*
looked like the one on top, entirely in phase.

- Are you feeding these commands via USB or network?
- Can you try a different slot/device?
- Can you try to feed these commands via USB (and Putty) directly into a
slot?

- Have you tried setting the "auto-clear phase on update" bit in one of
the CFRs before performing the update?

Regards,
Wolfgang
