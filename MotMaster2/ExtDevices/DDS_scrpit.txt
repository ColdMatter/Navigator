Factors in DDS script templates (*.dds files)

1. The file "seq.factors.FDDS" contains all the factors in all the scripts. 
Depending on the active script a subset of factors is shown.
The format is a list of:

fName1=Factor Title 1 [unit]
Factor title is shown on the virtual external device, and the factor name is in the script.

Example:
fct1=Factor 1 [deg]
fct2=Factor 2 [Hz]
fct3=Factor 3 [MHz]
fct4=Factor 4 [dBm]
fct5=Factor 5 [us]
fct6=Factor 6 [ns]

2. DDS script template defines the pattern of generated signal

The templates can be generated manually OR using LabView components and replacing the some places with factor names enclosed in $ brackets.

Addiionally to the factors from the list there are number of selectable extra factors. Their names start with "select-..." as on 4th line in the example bellow.

Example:
dds 0 reset
dcp 0 spi:CFR2=0x$fct1$
dcp 0 spi:STP0=0x$fct2$
dcp 0 wait::$select-bnc.trigger$
dcp 0 update:u
dcp 0 spi:STP0=0x$fct3$
dcp 0 wait:$fct4$h:
dcp 0 update:u

dcp 0 spi:STP0=0x$fct8$
dcp 0 wait:$fct9$h:
dcp 0 update:u

dcp 0 spi:STP0=0x$fct10$
dcp 0 wait:$fct11$h:
dcp 0 update:u

dcp 0 update:-d
dcp 0 spi:CFR2=0x1200080
dcp 0 spi:STP0=0x418937
dcp 0 wait:62500h:
dcp 0 update:u
dcp 0 start

3. Depending on the factor unit different convertions from the factor value in virtual device to DDS script are applied. 

us, and ns - are decimal integers in wait command respectively in micro-sec and nano-sec (high-resolution mode)

All others are converted to 6-byte hexa-decimal integers:

deg - degree, usually phase
Hz, kHz, MHz - frequency
dBm - amplitude 

4. In case that the value in virtual device is missing, a default value of 0 is assigned.
